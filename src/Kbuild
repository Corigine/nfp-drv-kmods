# GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
#
# Version 2, June 1991
# Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
# 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA
#
# Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
# license document, but changing it is not allowed.
#
# Preamble
#
# The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
# share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
# intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
# make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
# License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to
# any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
# Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public
# License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
#
# When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
# General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom
# to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you
# wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you
# can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that
# you know you can do these things.
#
# To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to
# deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
# restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute
# copies of the software, or if you modify it.
#
# For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or
# for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You
# must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you
# must show them these terms so they know their rights.
#
# We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)
# offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
# and/or modify the software.
#
# Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
# everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If
# the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its
# recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any
# problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors'
# reputations.
#
# Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We
# wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
# individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
# proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent
# must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
#
# The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
# follow.
#
# TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
#
# 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
# notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the
# terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any
# such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the
# Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
# containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
# modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter,
# translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)
# Each licensee is addressed as "you".
#
# Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered
# by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program
# is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its
# contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been
# made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the
# Program does.
#
# 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code
# as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
# appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
# disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
# License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of
# the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
#
# You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you
# may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
#
# 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it,
# thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such
# modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you
# also meet all of these conditions:
#
#
# a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
# you changed the files and the date of any change.
#
# b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or
# in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be
# licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of
# this License.
#
# c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,
# you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most
# ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate
# copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying
# that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program
# under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
# License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
# normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not
# required to print an announcement.)
#
# These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
# sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be
# reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then
# this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you
# distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections
# as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of
# the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other
# licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part
# regardless of who wrote it.
#
# Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
# rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise
# the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works
# based on the Program.
#
# In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with
# the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage
# or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of
# this License.
#
# 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
# Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections
# 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
#
# a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
# code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
# on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
#
# b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to
# give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically
# performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
# corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
# and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
#
# c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
# distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only
# for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in
# object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection
# b above.)
#
# The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
# modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all
# the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
# definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and
# installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source
# code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed
# (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler,
# kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs,
# unless that component itself accompanies the executable.
#
# If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to
# copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
# source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code,
# even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with
# the object code.
#
# 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except
# as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,
# modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically
# terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received
# copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
# terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
#
# 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed
# it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the
# Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you
# do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the
# Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of
# this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
# distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.
#
# 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
# Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
# licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms
# and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the
# recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible
# for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
#
# 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
# infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
# conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
# otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
# excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so
# as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any
# other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute
# the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit
# royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies
# directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both
# it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the
# Program.
#
# If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
# particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and
# the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
#
# It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents
# or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims;
# this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free
# software distribution system, which is implemented by public license
# practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range
# of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent
# application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or
# she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a
# licensee cannot impose that choice.
#
# This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
# consequence of the rest of this License.
#
# 8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
# countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
# copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an
# explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so
# that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.
# In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the
# body of this License.
#
# 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
# the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be
# similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
# address new problems or concerns.
#
# Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
# specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
# later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
# either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
# Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of
# this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
# Foundation.
#
# 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs
# whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for
# permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
# Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make
# exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of
# preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of
# promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
#
# NO WARRANTY
#
# 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
# FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN
# OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
# PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
# OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
# MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO
# THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM
# PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
# CORRECTION.
#
# 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
# WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
# REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
# INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
# OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
# LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR
# THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
# PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
# POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
