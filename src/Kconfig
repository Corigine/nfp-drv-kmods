config NET_VENDOR_NETRONOME
	bool "Netronome(R) devices"
	default y
	---help---
	  If you have a Netronome(R) network (Ethernet) card or device, say Y.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about Netronome(R) cards. If you say Y, you will be
	  asked for your specific card in the following questions.
