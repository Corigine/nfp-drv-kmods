 * GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
 *
 * Version 2, June 1991
 * Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 * 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA
 *
 * Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
 * license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 *
 * Preamble
 *
 * The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
 * share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
 * intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
 * make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
 * License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to
 * any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
 * Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public
 * License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
 *
 * When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
 * General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom
 * to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you
 * wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you
 * can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that
 * you know you can do these things.
 *
 * To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to
 * deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
 * restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute
 * copies of the software, or if you modify it.
 *
 * For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or
 * for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You
 * must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you
 * must show them these terms so they know their rights.
 *
 * We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)
 * offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
 * and/or modify the software.
 *
 * Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
 * everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If
 * the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its
 * recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any
 * problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors'
 * reputations.
 *
 * Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We
 * wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
 * individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
 * proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent
 * must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
 *
 * The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
 * follow.
 *
 * TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
 *
 * 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
 * notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the
 * terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any
 * such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the
 * Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
 * containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
 * modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter,
 * translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)
 * Each licensee is addressed as "you".
 *
 * Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered
 * by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program
 * is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its
 * contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been
 * made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the
 * Program does.
 *
 * 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code
 * as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
 * appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
 * disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
 * License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of
 * the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
 *
 * You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you
 * may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
 *
 * 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it,
 * thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such
 * modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you
 * also meet all of these conditions:
 *
 *
 * a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
 * you changed the files and the date of any change.
 *
 * b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or
 * in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be
 * licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of
 * this License.
 *
 * c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,
 * you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most
 * ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate
 * copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying
 * that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program
 * under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
 * License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
 * normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not
 * required to print an announcement.)
 *
 * These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
 * sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be
 * reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then
 * this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you
 * distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections
 * as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of
 * the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other
 * licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part
 * regardless of who wrote it.
 *
 * Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
 * rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise
 * the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works
 * based on the Program.
 *
 * In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with
 * the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage
 * or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of
 * this License.
 *
 * 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
 * Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections
 * 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
 *
 * a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
 * code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
 * on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
 *
 * b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to
 * give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically
 * performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
 * corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
 * and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
 *
 * c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
 * distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only
 * for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in
 * object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection
 * b above.)
 *
 * The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
 * modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all
 * the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
 * definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and
 * installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source
 * code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed
 * (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler,
 * kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs,
 * unless that component itself accompanies the executable.
 *
 * If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to
 * copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
 * source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code,
 * even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with
 * the object code.
 *
 * 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except
 * as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,
 * modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically
 * terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received
 * copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
 * terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
 *
 * 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed
 * it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the
 * Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you
 * do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the
 * Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of
 * this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
 * distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.
 *
 * 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
 * Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
 * licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms
 * and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the
 * recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible
 * for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
 *
 * 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
 * infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
 * conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
 * otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
 * excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so
 * as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any
 * other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute
 * the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit
 * royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies
 * directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both
 * it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the
 * Program.
 *
 * If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
 * particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and
 * the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
 *
 * It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents
 * or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims;
 * this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free
 * software distribution system, which is implemented by public license
 * practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range
 * of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent
 * application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or
 * she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a
 * licensee cannot impose that choice.
 *
 * This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
 * consequence of the rest of this License.
 *
 * 8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
 * countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
 * copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an
 * explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so
 * that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.
 * In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the
 * body of this License.
 *
 * 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
 * the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be
 * similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
 * address new problems or concerns.
 *
 * Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
 * specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
 * later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
 * either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
 * Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of
 * this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
 * Foundation.
 *
 * 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs
 * whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for
 * permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
 * Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make
 * exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of
 * preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of
 * promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
 *
 * NO WARRANTY
 *
 * 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
 * FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN
 * OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
 * PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
 * OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
 * MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO
 * THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM
 * PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
 * CORRECTION.
 *
 * 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
 * WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
 * REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
 * INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
 * OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
 * LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR
 * THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
 * PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
 * POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
